# Sudoku Game

## Overview
This project is a Java-based Sudoku game featuring a graphical user interface. It provides an interactive Sudoku puzzle experience with multiple difficulty levels and visual feedback for user actions.

There are two main implementations in this project:
- **Applet-based Sudoku (`Sudoku.java`, `SolvedBoards.java`)**: The primary playable version, designed as a Java Applet using AWT.
- **Swing-based Sudoku Panel (`SudokuPanel`)**: A partial implementation using Swing, referencing classes (`SudokuPuzzle`, `SudokuGenerator`, `SudokuPuzzleType`) that are not present in this repository and may not be runnable as-is.

## Features
- **Difficulty Levels**: Easy, Medium, Hard
- **Interactive Board**: Click a square, then click a number to fill it in
- **Color Feedback**:
  - Blue: Pre-filled numbers
  - Green: Correct user input
  - Red: Incorrect user input
  - Yellow: Highlighted selection
- **Win Message**: Displays a congratulatory message when the puzzle is solved

## How to Build and Run
### Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or earlier (for applet support)

### Compile
Navigate to the `src` directory and compile the Java files:
```bash
javac Sudoku.java SolvedBoards.java
```

### Run (Applet)
Applets are deprecated in modern Java and browsers. If you have an older JDK, you can use the `appletviewer` tool:

1. Create an HTML file (e.g., `Sudoku.html`) with the following content:
    ```html
    <html>
    <body>
      <applet code="Sudoku.class" width="600" height="720"></applet>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
2. Run the applet:
    ```bash
    appletviewer Sudoku.html
    ```

> **Note:** Modern Java versions and browsers do not support applets. For best results, use JDK 8 or earlier.
